# DESCRIPTION

This app demonstrates the fundamental usage of [Itokuto](https://github.com/eosobande/itokuto)

The app idea was originally done by [Chris Ching (@CodeWithChris)](https://twitter.com/codewithchris)
with SwiftUI. 

I thought it would be a good idea to see how close this could get to replicating a UI developed in
SwiftUI, since SwiftUI inspired the architecture approach for this library.
